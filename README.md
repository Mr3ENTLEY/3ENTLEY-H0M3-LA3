# 3ENTLEY-HOME-LAB Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation of the 3ENTLEY-HOME-LAB. This document serves as an introduction to the various components that comprise the lab environment. For detailed information on each specific device or service, please refer to the corresponding README file within the relevant device or service directory.

## Services

Each service in the 3ENTLEY-HOME-LAB is designed to simulate an enterprise-level environment, allowing for robust practice, development, and testing. Here's an outline of the primary services and their purposes:

### Active Directory

**Purpose**: The Active Directory (AD) service is the cornerstone of the lab, providing directory services and user management akin to a corporate environment. It is essential for practicing AD administration skills, including group policy, user provisioning, and access control. 

**Benefits**: With AD, experimentation is encouraged, enabling the refinement of skills without the risk associated with production environments, such as data loss or service disruption.

### File Sharing & Backups

**Purpose**: The File Sharing and Backup service ensures that all devices, whether domain-joined or not, can backup their data seamlessly. It doubles as a media sharing hub, centralizing access to shared resources across the network.

**Benefits**: This setup reflects real-world scenarios where mixed environments exist, demonstrating domain integration and non-domain access strategies.

### IIS Web Services

**Purpose**: IIS Web Services support the hosting and management of web applications within the lab. This includes configuring websites, managing security certificates, and understanding application pools.

**Benefits**: Hands-on experience with IIS equips you with the knowledge to deploy and manage web applications and services securely and efficiently, reflecting the responsibilities of a web server administrator.
