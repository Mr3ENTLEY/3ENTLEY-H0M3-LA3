3ENTLEYS H0M3 LA3

This repository stores the data and configration of the 3ENTLEY H0M3 LA3

The lab supports multiple guests of any operating system. This is accomplished using the Microsoft Hyper-V Virtualization Platform and an Asus ROG Strix G531GT running Windows 11 Pro. The host has an Intel i5-9300H (2.4GHz, 4 cores, 8 logical processors) CPU, 32GB of DDR4 (dual-channel) RAM, a 1TB M.2 SSD, and an Nvidia GTX 1650 independent graphics card.

Guest systems are currently limited to 1 Windows Server running the IIS Role for hosting the front end of the 3ENTLEY H0M3 LA3. This configuration will be updated for reference uppon due time.

Within this repository, I have multiple directories for easier navigation and simplicity. Catagories first reference the OS Manufacture. "Microsoft" for Windows and more. Sub catagories are named by the software or protocol used by the manufacturers OS. Names like "Powershell", "RDP" or "IIS" are protocols and software names of Microsoft server roles and features.
