### SERVICES

---

#### Active Directory
Active Directory is the primary service running in this environment. The purpose of this service, within the lab environment is to provide enterprise level services for practicing. This further allows me to develop and refine my Active Directory administration and allows for freedom of testing configurations without the fear of failures or perminant data loss.

---

#### File Sharing \ Backups
This service provides space for backups of devices on the network as well as seamless media sharing within the lab environment. At this time, devices which are not joined to the domain still backup to this file share. This is because users for these devices were created within the domain, thus allowing the non domian joined devices to backup to the file share without failure.
